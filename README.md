Titanic

Method used: Random Forest / Conditional forest
Dealing with: Missing data- Predicted, manually assigned and set as the median value depending on the variable missing | Feature Selection – | Feature Engineering-
Hard parts&solutions: Pre processing the data – Age: rpart/predict. Embarked: Assigned manually. Fare: median. Family ID: re-group.
Time spent: 19 days
Contribution: Eric: Scripted & Researched models |  Kashif: Researched models, Scripted & Formatted the data | Yonathan: Researched models

Bike Sharing

Method used: Gradient Boosted Tree. Trained separate models to predict the number of registered users and casual users. Combined the predictions of both models.
Dealing with: Feature Engineering – Split date-time into year, month,day, hour and weekday.
Hard parts&solutions: Feature Engineering. Split the data and see if there are variances in the number of bikes being rented according to any split. Make the relevant splits of data a feature.
Time spent: 10 days
